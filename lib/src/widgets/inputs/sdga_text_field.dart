/// A SDGA Design text field.
///
/// A text field lets the user enter text, either with hardware keyboard or with
/// an onscreen keyboard.
///
/// The text field calls the [onChanged] callback whenever the user changes the
/// text in the field. If the user indicates that they are done typing in the
/// field (e.g., by pressing a button on the soft keyboard), the text field
/// calls the [onSubmitted] callback.
///
/// To control the text that is displayed in the text field, use the
/// [controller]. For example, to set the initial value of the text field, use
/// a [controller] that already contains some text. The [controller] can also
/// control the selection and composing region (and to observe changes to the
/// text, selection, and composing region).
///
/// You can use the [decoration] property to control the decoration,
/// for example by adding a label or an icon.
///
/// If [decoration] is non-null (which is the default), the text field requires
/// one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// When the widget has focus, it will prevent itself from disposing via its
/// underlying [EditableText]'s [AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.wantKeepAlive] in
/// order to avoid losing the selection. Removing the focus will allow it to be
/// disposed.
///
/// Remember to call [TextEditingController.dispose] on the [TextEditingController]
/// when it is no longer needed. This will ensure we discard any resources used
/// by the object.
///
/// If this field is part of a scrolling container that lazily constructs its
/// children, like a [ListView] or a [CustomScrollView], then a [controller]
/// should be specified. The controller's lifetime should be managed by a
/// stateful widget ancestor of the scrolling container.
///
/// ## Reading values
///
/// A common way to read a value from a TextField is to use the [onSubmitted]
/// callback. This callback is applied to the text field's current value when
/// the user finishes editing.
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.EditableText.lifeCycle}
///
/// For most applications the [onSubmitted] callback will be sufficient for
/// reacting to user input.
///
/// The [onEditingComplete] callback also runs when the user finishes editing.
/// It's different from [onSubmitted] because it has a default value which
/// updates the text controller and yields the keyboard focus. Applications that
/// require different behavior can override the default [onEditingComplete]
/// callback.
///
/// Keep in mind you can also always read the current string from a TextField's
/// [TextEditingController] using [TextEditingController.text].
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.EditableText.onChanged}
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.editableText.showCaretOnScreen}
///
/// {@macro flutter.widgets.editableText.accessibility}
///
/// ## Scrolling Considerations
///
/// If this [SDGATextField] is not a descendant of [Scaffold] and is being used
/// within a [Scrollable] or nested [Scrollable]s, consider placing a
/// [ScrollNotificationObserver] above the root [Scrollable] that contains this
/// [SDGATextField] to ensure proper scroll coordination for [SDGATextField] and its
/// components like [TextSelectionOverlay].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [TextFormField], which integrates with the [Form] widget.
///  * [SDGAInputDecorator], which shows the labels and other visual elements that
///    surround the actual text editing widget.
///  * [EditableText], which is the raw text editing control at the heart of a
///    [SDGATextField]. The [EditableText] widget is rarely used directly unless
///    you are implementing an entirely different design language, such as
///    Cupertino.
class SDGATextField extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Creates a SDGA text field.
  ///
  /// The text field requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
  ///
  /// The [maxLines] property can be set to null to remove the restriction on
  /// the number of lines. By default, it is one, meaning this is a single-line
  /// text field. [maxLines] must not be zero.
  ///
  /// The [maxLength] property is set to null by default, which means the
  /// number of characters allowed in the text field is not restricted. If
  /// [maxLength] is set a character counter will be displayed below the
  /// field showing how many characters have been entered. If the value is
  /// set to a positive integer it will also display the maximum allowed
  /// number of characters to be entered. If the value is set to
  /// [SDGATextField.noMaxLength] then only the current length is displayed.
  ///
  /// After [maxLength] characters have been input, additional input
  /// is ignored, unless [maxLengthEnforcement] is set to
  /// [MaxLengthEnforcement.none].
  /// The text field enforces the length with a [LengthLimitingTextInputFormatter],
  /// which is evaluated after the supplied [inputFormatters], if any.
  /// The [maxLength] value must be either null or greater than zero.
  ///
  /// If [maxLengthEnforcement] is set to [MaxLengthEnforcement.none], then more
  /// than [maxLength] characters may be entered, and the error counter and
  /// divider will switch to the [decoration].errorStyle when the limit is
  /// exceeded.
  ///
  /// The text cursor is not shown if [showCursor] is false or if [showCursor]
  /// is null (the default) and [readOnly] is true.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [maxLength], which discusses the precise meaning of "number of
  ///    characters" and how it may differ from the intuitive meaning.
